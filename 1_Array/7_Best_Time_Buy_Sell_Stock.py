Problem Statement:
You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.
You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.
Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.
Example:
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.

Thought Process:

'''
def maxProfit(prices):
    min_price = float('inf')
    max_profit = 0
    for price in prices:
        if price < min_price:
            min_price = price
        elif price - min_price > max_profit:
            max_profit = price - min_price
    return max_profit
# Example usage:
prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
result = maxProfit(prices)
print("The maximum profit is:", result)
